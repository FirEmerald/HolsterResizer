# HolsterResizer

A simple mod for Bonelab which resizes the gun holsters and their contents when using a small avatar so they don't get in the way of things.

If BoneLib is installed there's also a submenu where you can configure:
- SizeMultiplier: Adjust the relative size of the holsters
- Scale Up: Determines if the holsters scale up with big avatars
- Scale Down: Determines if the holsters scale down with small avatars
- Scale Bodylog: Determines if the bodylog also gets resized with avatars

Compatible with Fusion
